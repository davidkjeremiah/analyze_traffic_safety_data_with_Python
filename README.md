# **Analyze Traffic Safety Data with Python**

## **Overview**
This case study takes you through an analysis of car collision rates and smartphone usage over time. 

## **Objective:**

* visualize time-series data
* do exploratory data analysis
* use linear regression for prediction
* compare predicted and actual outcomes

## **Datasets**

One dataset we’re working with comprises monthly total numbers of collisions in the United States from 2006 to 2020 normalized to the population size. This dataset was cleaned and modified to aggregate collisions with different outcomes to streamline our analysis. The original data can be found on the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s](https://cdan.nhtsa.gov/query) website.

A second dataset we’ll work with comprises the quarterly percent of American adults that report owning and using a smartphone. This dataset has been cleaned and modified to only include information relevant to our analyses. The unaltered data can be found on the [Pew Research Center’s](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/) website.
